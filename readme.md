SuperBlinky
-----------

SuperBlinky is a device that blinks two LEDs instead of just one as does a standard Blinky.

SuperBlinky requires an Arduino Uno board.

This repository contains the files required to build the firmware for SuperBlinky.

How to use these files
----------------------
1. Clone this repository.
2. Connect an LED with a 470-ohm current-limiting resistor to Arduino Uno pin 3.
3. Connect the Arduino Uno to the computer.
4. Open the file SuperBlinky.ino in the Arduino IDE.
5. Select the Arduino Uno in the Arduino IDE.
6. Select the serial port of the Arduino Uno in the Arduino IDE.
7. Click the Upload button of the Arduino IDE.
